# Analysis-of-Cheese-Varieties
Analysis of a collection of observations of cheese samples from two manufacturers 

# Summary
The objective was to determine if a model can be constructed that can classify new cheese samples into the texture categories using the thermophysical properties as predictors. Here, the groups of cheese textures are known a-priori, thus an appropriate method to apply is discriminant analysis which develops a rule based on the computation of discriminant functions to predict the group membership of new observations based on other features.
